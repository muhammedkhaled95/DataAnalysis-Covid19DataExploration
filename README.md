# DataAnalysis-Covid19DataExploration
Project exploring the Covid-19 data.

This is a small and quick project on data exploration of Covid-19 data using Our World in Data website dataset and you can find it in this link

And this project was a good refresher for SQL basics for me, and was guided by Alex the Analyst on youtube, and Here is a link to his great channel.

In this project, I have explored the data of this dataset, created a couple of views for future visualization on Tableau or Power BI.

This might be an on going small project, so future updates and better documentation might be on the way.
